# Advanced OOP Principles and Design Patterns (Python)

This repository contains a single comprehensive Python file `advanced_oop_principles.py` that demonstrates:

- Object-Oriented Programming principles (Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Association, Aggregation, Composition)
- Software design principles (SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, etc.)
- Design patterns (Singleton, Factory, Builder, Adapter, Composite, Decorator, Proxy, Observer, Strategy, Command, State)
- Core Python best practices (typing, logging, unit tests, PEP8 compliance)

.\.venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install requirements:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the main demo:

```powershell
python advanced_oop_principles.py
```

4. Run tests:

```powershell
pytest -q
```
